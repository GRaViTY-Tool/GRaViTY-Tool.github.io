# The GRaViTY-Tool
Today’s software systems tend to be used on a long-term basis, are highly interconnected, share many common parts, and often process security-critical data, so that keeping up with ever-changing security precautions, attacks, and mitigations is vital to preserve a system’s security. Model-based system development enables us to address security issues already in the early phases of the software design, as in UML models. The continuous changes in the security assumptions and the design of software systems —for instance, due to structural decay— have to be reflected in both the system models (e.g., UML models) and the system’s implementation (including program models). The detection of which change is necessary currently needs to be performed manually by developers.

Using the GRaViTY tool, we are studying approaches for automatically detecting and performing necessary changes on a single representation of the system and keeping all other representations synchronized with this changed representation. Allowing developers to develop systems in a model-based manner and dealing with the structural decay of long-living systems.
